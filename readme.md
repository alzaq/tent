## Features

* Runs locally or on the server
* Supports options for document and file storage directories, like so: `node node_modules/tent/server/index.js --docs=content --public=public --relativeMediaDir=/media/`
* Smart attachement handling: resizes and optimizes images, stores everything else. Inserts a relative link into the document body (where the cursor is), after you drag & drop the file.

## Usage

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
